# ANNs_Shear_Slotted_CFS_Channels
Artificial neural networks for predicting elastic buckling load and shear strength of CFS channels with slotted webs

The ANNs models are described in V.V. Degtyarev, Neural networks for predicting shear strength of CFS channels with slotted webs, Journal of Constructional Steel Research (submitted).

The dataset used for the model training: Degtyarev, Vitaliy; Degtyareva, Natalia (2020), “Elastic shear buckling loads and ultimate shear strengths of CFS channels with slotted webs: FE simulation results”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/t9hhkngdwv.1
